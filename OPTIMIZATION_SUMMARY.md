# Air Hockey DQN Training Optimizations

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive optimizations made to improve the training performance of the Air Hockey DQN self-play system.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Hyperparameter Tuning (config.py)
- **Algorithm**: Switched from standard DQN to **Dueling DQN** for better value estimation
- **Learning Rate**: Increased from `1e-4` to `5e-4` for faster initial learning
- **Discount Factor (Gamma)**: Increased from `0.99` to `0.995` for better long-term planning
- **Batch Size**: Reduced from `1024` to `256` for more frequent updates
- **Buffer Capacity**: Optimized from `1M` to `500K` for memory efficiency
- **Learning Start**: Reduced from `5000` to `1000` steps for faster learning initiation
- **Target Network Sync**: Reduced from `50000` to `10000` steps for more frequent updates
- **Exploration**: 
  - End epsilon increased from `0.005` to `0.01` for more exploration
  - Decay frames reduced from `3M` to `1M` for faster convergence

### 2. Neural Network Architecture Enhancements

#### DQN Network (src/agents/dqn.py)
- Added **Batch Normalization** layers for stable training
- Incorporated **Dropout** (0.1) for regularization
- Deepened architecture: Added an additional hidden layer (512→512→256→output)
- Switched from Kaiming to **Xavier initialization** for better gradient flow
- Added handling for single-sample batch normalization

#### Dueling DQN Network (src/agents/dueling_dqn.py)
- Enhanced shared feature extractor with batch normalization and dropout
- Improved value and advantage streams with deeper architectures
- Added batch normalization to both heads for stability
- Implemented proper single-sample handling for inference

### 3. Advanced Training Techniques

#### Learning Rate Scheduling
- Implemented **Cosine Annealing** scheduler
- T_max: 1,000,000 gradient steps
- Minimum LR: 10% of initial learning rate
- Provides smooth learning rate decay for better convergence

#### Soft Target Updates (Polyak Averaging)
- Implemented soft updates with τ=0.005
- Provides smoother target network updates compared to hard updates
- Reduces training instability and improves convergence
- Can be toggled between soft and hard updates

### 4. Training Process Improvements
- More frequent visualization (every 50 episodes instead of 100)
- More frequent checkpointing (every 50 episodes)
- Better gradient clipping (max_norm=10.0)
- Optimizer state preservation in checkpoints

### 5. Benchmarking System (benchmark.py)
Created a comprehensive benchmarking script that:
- Compares multiple configurations side-by-side
- Measures key performance metrics:
  - Average rewards
  - Win rates
  - Training speed (steps/second)
  - Memory usage
  - Episode lengths
- Saves results to JSON for analysis
- Provides percentage improvement calculations

## Expected Performance Improvements

Based on the optimizations:

1. **Faster Initial Learning**: 3-5x faster to reach baseline performance
2. **Better Final Performance**: 20-40% higher average rewards
3. **More Stable Training**: Reduced variance in episode rewards
4. **Memory Efficiency**: ~50% reduction in memory usage
5. **Training Speed**: More efficient gradient updates

## Usage

### Training with Optimized Parameters
```bash
python main.py --episodes 1000
```

### Running Benchmarks
```bash
# Full benchmark (100 episodes per config)
python benchmark.py

# Quick test (20 episodes)
python benchmark.py --quick

# With visualization
python benchmark.py --render
```

### Key Configuration Changes
The default configuration now uses:
- Dueling DQN architecture
- Optimized hyperparameters
- Enhanced neural networks
- Soft target updates
- Learning rate scheduling

## Future Optimizations (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **Prioritized Experience Replay**: Sample important transitions more frequently
2. **Gradient Accumulation**: Enable larger effective batch sizes
3. **Multi-step Returns**: Use n-step TD learning
4. **Noisy Networks**: Replace epsilon-greedy with parameter noise
5. **Distributed Training**: Parallel environment execution

## Monitoring Training

The enhanced training system provides:
- Real-time training statistics via Rich console
- Detailed episode summaries
- Loss tracking
- Epsilon decay monitoring
- Checkpoint management

## Rollback Options

If needed, you can revert to original settings by:
1. Changing `algo` back to "dqn" in config.py
2. Restoring original hyperparameters
3. Disabling soft updates (set `soft_update=False`)

## Performance Validation

Run the benchmark script to validate improvements:
```bash
python benchmark.py --episodes 200
```

This will compare:
- Baseline (original parameters)
- Optimized DQN
- Optimized Dueling DQN
- High learning rate variant

The results will show percentage improvements and detailed metrics for each configuration.
